  <p>
    <bold>Machine Learning in Python </bold>is the ability of the computer to learn without being explicitly programmed. In layman’s terms, it can be described as automating the learning process of computers based on their experiences without any human assistance. Machine learning is actively used in our daily life and perhaps in more places than one would expect
